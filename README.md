# Card Management Application (Beta Version)
## Description
OneCredit will help you manage your credit cards, get notified when an annual fee is due, save money and earn you more cash back every day by maximizing credit card spending bonuses, and offers.

OneCredit automatically selects the credit card that earns you the most cash back on every purchase. With saving data in the server, you can store your card information e.g. card number, expiry date, and CVC in the app, and you'll immediately know your card info to make online purchases without a physical card on hand. With the reminder feature, you will get notified when a payment is due, when offers expire, and when your annual fee is due.
